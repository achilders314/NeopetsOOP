An original Neopets project to get back to my roots and practice my object oriented programming and jQuery.

### Description
In this Neopets/Tomagotchi game you get to care for a virtual pet. Happiness and hunger slowly change on a timer, and your pet can give you hints what to do next. Feed, heal, and play with your pets to keep them happy. See how long you can keep them happy without running out of supplies!

### Technologies Used
- jQuery
- JavaScript
- Vanilla CSS
- HTML

### Features
- Health, Happiness, and Hunger bars.
- A drop-down menu to select which Neopet you want to care for.
- Buttons to Feed, Heal, and Play with your pet.
- A "Game Over" image when you run out or health/happiness, your pet gets too hungry, or you run out of supplies.

### Lessons Learned
- Brushed up on jQuery
- Remembered how to use Set Timeout to get the happiness to decrease and hunger to increase. They also track how much total time has happened in the game.
- Brushed up on Object-Oriented Programming
